name: billing
description: Use when the user wants to check usage, view invoices, or manage payment methods on Zilliz Cloud.
---

## Prerequisites

1. CLI installed and logged in via OAuth (see setup skill).
2. Billing features require OAuth login — API Key mode may not have access.

## Commands Reference

### Query Usage

```bash
# Last N days
zilliz billing usage --last 7d

# Last month
zilliz billing usage --month last

# Custom date range
zilliz billing usage --start 2026-01-01 --end 2026-01-31
```

### List Invoices

```bash
zilliz billing invoices
```

### View Invoice Details

```bash
zilliz billing invoices --invoice-id <invoice-id>
```

### Bind a Credit Card

This command requires interactive input. Instruct the user to run in their own terminal:

```
zilliz billing bind-card
```

## Guidance

- Billing commands require OAuth login, not API Key authentication.
- When the user asks about costs or spending, use `billing usage` with an appropriate time range.
- The `bind-card` command requires interactive input and CANNOT run inside Claude Code.
